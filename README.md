# tmux-config

This is my tmux config that I use at home, work, and school.

Basic commands to get started:

Type "tmux" to begin a new session
"tmux a" to attach to old session
or "tmux ls" and "tmux a -t <session number>" to attach to a specific older session

Modifier: Ctrl + a
Horizontal split: mod + -
Vertical split: mod + |
New window: mod + c
Next window: mod + n
Previous window: mod + p
